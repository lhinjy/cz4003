Project: Text Image Segmentation for Optimal Optical character recognition 

Files: Project.pdf,  Lin_HuangJiayin_Project_Report.pdf, algorithm.py, tesseract.py, otsu_algorithm.py

- algorithm.py: change "image_name" on line 13, and get_text() for the type of algo to be applied on the image. Tesseract will then be called and the text(deceipher-ed) will be saved onto a .txt and console
